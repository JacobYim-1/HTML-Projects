                <!-- to create a link, we need an anchor element "a" -->
                <a>click me</a>
            </li>
        

            <li>
                <!-- clicking on this anchor element doesn't have anywhere to go, so we need to give it a direction.
                we can give it a destination by using the HTML attribute with "href" aka hypertext reference-->
                <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>

                How to open links in a new tab:
                - We need to add another attribute: "target"
                
                -target: specifies where the linked resource will be opened, 
                "target" values: default is "_self", to open in a new window "_blank"

                -while using (target:"_blank") it is important to also 
                include attribute: (rel:"noopener noreferrer")


                -the noopener value prevents the opened linked from gainiing access to the webpage from which it was opened
                -the norefferer value prevents the opened linked from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it
                -basically prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one
                to trick users

                -->

            its another page on the same site.  -->

            <!-- It would be better to add (./) to the link to prevent issues. this would specify to look for
